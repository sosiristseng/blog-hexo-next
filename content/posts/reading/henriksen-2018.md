## Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity
* Anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin) : broad-spectrum antineoplastic

* dose-related cardiomyocyte injury => LV dysfunction, HF. Cardiac event rates on treatment were 7%, 18% and 65% at cumulative doses of 150 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2 and 550 mg/m2, respectively
## Mechanism of anthracycline cardiotoxicity
![fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40054455/86618936-522ba300-bfec-11ea-8784-cd3c44829c2a.jpg)
* Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and **inhibiting Topoisomerase 2β in cardiomyocytes**, as well as iron accumulation inside mitochondria

## Risk markers for anthracycline cardiotoxicity
* cumulative dose, female sex, African-American ancestry, age >65 years or <18 years, renal failure and concomitant exposure of the heart to radiation therapy
* concentrations of Top 2β in peripheral blood leucocytes: low = more resistant to anthracycline cardiotoxicity
* The hiPSC-CMs from patients who developed LVEF depression exhibited increased cell death and ROS production following in vitro doxorubicin challenge

## Monitoring for cardiotoxicity
### LVEF and global longitudinal strain
* LVEF decrease of >10 percentage points from baseline to a value <53% on repeat confirmatory echocardiographic imaging
* Baseline LV dysfunction is a strong marker for developing heart failure complications with anthracycline
### Cardiac biomarkers
* Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T

## Prevention and treatment of cardiotoxicity
### Anthracycline derivatives and infusion protocols
* Reducing the cumulative anthracycline dose
* Liposomal encapsulation: modifies tissue distribution, but expensive
### Dexrazoxane (DRZ)
* DRZ is taken up rapidly by the myocardium following infusion and competes with ATP-binding sites on **Top 2β**
* Concerns about less effective treatment in children: restricted use in adults with metastatic breast cancer receiving **higher cumulative anthracycline dose**
### Angiotensin inhibition and β-blockade
* decline in LVEF => ACEi/ARB and β-blockers
* Primary prevention with β-blockade, ACEi and ARBs? Under studies
### Primary prevention with statins
* More research is needed
## Conclusions
* Anthracycline chemotherapy remains an important and effective treatment for breast cancer, haematological malignancies and sarcoma
* cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent
* Testing: LVEF, cTnI
* Cardioprotective therapies: DRZ, ACEi/ARB and β-blockers
