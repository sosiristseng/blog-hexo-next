## Outline

- Top nine errors that TW researchers make and lead to rejection of their papers.
- Word choice, [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/)
- Habits for productive writing : *15 minutes per day*
- Dirty tricks to publish more papers (e.g. choose the right journal and customize your paper for the editors)
- Deal with rejections and revive the failed paper.

## The publication challenge

Only **11% acceptance rate** for average quality papers. ==8 out of 9 are rejected==.

### Greatest causes of rejection in TW

- Poor English
- Unclear motivation
- Not useful, others could not benefit / extend from this study

### Most English errors

- Redundency: too wordy
- Verb tense: past vs present vs future
- Too much passive voice

## Prefer active voice to passive voice

Because active voice is generally shorter, clearer, and more direct than passive voice.

If you don't want `I` and `we` show up too many times, you could use the `study` as the subject.

### Situations for passive voice

- Subject ==unknown== / ==obvious== / ==irrevalent==
- The `Method` section: since the subject is apparent (we)
- The object is more important than the subject

## Verb tense

- **past**: one study. *single* time point `Their study in 2000 showed that ...`
- **present perfect**: many studies (*multiple* time points) `Previous studies have indicated that ...`
- **future**: not done, *do not* say that unless it is future work

## Prefer verbs to nouns and strong verbs to weak verbs

e.g. make an improvement -> improve

- Eliminate weak token verbs (undergone, make, ...)
- Make the setence shorter and clearer


## Stop using pronouns

Unclear subjects stress the mind of readers.

It is vital that S -> S must
