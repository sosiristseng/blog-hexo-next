In beta-cells, over the range 140-100 mV, the endogenous proton leak was roughly ohmic and exerted a high level of control over respiration and Œîp The activity of muscle contration is controlled by flux (ATP turnover) rather than ATP/ADP ratio, and the opposite in beta-cells. Mitochondrial respiration in INS-1 cells\" Mitochondrial respiration in INS-1 cells ŒîpH increased from ‚àí0.13 units in 2.5 mM glucose to ‚àí0.51 units in 16.7 mM glucose, probably as a consequence of Ca2+ uptake into the matrix. Thus, even a quantitative estimate (e.g. in microscopy) of Œîœà hyperpolarization cannot be equated with a change in Œîp unless the ŒîpH component is also determined.

When ATP/ADP ratio decreases, open probability of these channels increases, setting membrane potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Substrate deprivation or localized laser flash can trigger cellwide oscillations or collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in isolated cardiomyocytes, which can be interrupted or prevented either by employing ROS scavengers or applying ligands of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, which are known inhibitors of an inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) The mechanism involves mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggering the activation of IMAC in a positive feedback loop causing energy dissipation and the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Uncoupled mitochondria consume intracellular ATP stores, driving the activation of the KATP channel (11) and consequently producing significant changes in the action potential duration (APD). The processes cannot be easily understood without a comprehensive model as a tool, and technically very difficult to simultaneously measure metabolites, ions, metabolic fluxes, and currents in experiments on cardiomyocytes.

Muscles of insects, hummingbirds, and humans can reach metabolic rates from 50 to more than 100 times their resting rates, and ATP is efficiently produced at both conditions. In well-coupled mitochondria (Q = 300 mV), nearly 100% of the oxidase can be in the form of the intermediate, V, consistent with spectral change (high-spin ferric form to the low-spin ferric form) in the experiments. In uncoupled mitochondria, the concentration is vanishingly small, and this would be expected for preparations of isolated cytochrome oxidase as well The oxygen dependence of respiration described by the steady-state rate expression for the model is consistent with the behavior of isolated mitochondria and intact cells The increases in free ADP and AMP, however, are large enough (Fig. 7) to cause substantial alterations in metabolism (e.g. AMPK pathway) ","date":"2020-10-23","objectID":"/posts/reading/wilson-2014/:4:0","tags":["complex 4","mitochondria"],"title":"üìí Wilson 2014","uri":"/posts/reading/wilson-2014/"},{"categories":["Reading"],"content":"Appendix A Steady-state kinetic expression for oxygen reduction by cytochrome c oxidase (Fig. 1).

The parameter Krel2 (crel in the original TNNP model), was also predicted poorly, most likely because it is partially redundant with the parameter Krel1 The surprise in our simulations was the poor prediction of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current, GKr. But preditions about slow delayed rectifier, GKs, was accurate. Overlapping in function was suggested. Two important factors influencing the accuracy of the conductance predictions are the number and quality of the outputs. Since the regression analyses provide insight into which physiological measures are independent and which are partially redundant, these types of simulation studies can be used to prioritize experiments Purposely excluded measures that quantify how cellular behavior changes after application of a pharmacological agent The primary advantage here is that reverse regression is simple and intuitive, and the outputs considered are well-defined metrics that are readily obtainable in the laboratory ","date":"2020-10-23","objectID":"/posts/reading/sarkar-2010/:3:0","tags":["ODE","electrophysiology","cardiomyocyte"],"title":"üìí Sarkar 2010","uri":"/posts/reading/sarkar-2010/"},{"categories":["Reading"],"content":"Reference Sarkar AX, Sobie EA.

But validation at the cell level does not necessarily imply that simulations will reproduce tissue-level phenomena anatomical fidelity of the computational mesh (3D models) The ability to perform validation of such models is of course heavily constrained by difficulties in obtaining the necessary experimental or clinical data for model validation, usually limited to heart surface potentials validation of organ-level CEP models with a specific clinical application; in particular, where a model is proposed to be used in clinical decision-making process used to predict sudden cardiac death risk in Arevalo et al\" process used to predict sudden cardiac death risk in Arevalo et al ","date":"2020-10-23","objectID":"/posts/reading/pathmanathan-2018/:6:3","tags":["electrophysiology","cardiomyocyte"],"title":"üìí Pathmanathan 2018","uri":"/posts/reading/pathmanathan-2018/"},{"categories":["Reading"],"content":"Discussion while general validation can provide important preliminary information about a computational model, it may not be advisable to convert general validation results into binary ‚Äúgood‚Äù/‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù/‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù statements when a COU of a model is chosen, previous general validation results can certainly be (re-)evaluated to determine how supportive they are of the model in the COU The CEP modeling community already leads the way in model sharing and reproduction through the CellML repository and related software One resource that provides a path toward such a repository is the Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab (Cooper et al., 2016). https://travis.cs.ox.ac.uk/FunctionalCuration/.

Under basal conditions (absence of Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation), IKs reduction had almost no effect on human and dog APs, but it severely prolonged the guinea pig AP. In the presence of Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation, IKs reduction affected all species to substantial degree. Rate-dependent INaK changes play a major role in APD rate dependence in human and dog. The role of INaK is secondary to [Na+] accumulation at fast rates. For guinea pig, IKs dominates APD rate dependence via its open-state accumulation at fast rate, while in human and dog under Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation, accumulation of IKs in available reserve closed states is important for proper AP repolarization and APD shortening at fast rate.

However, our model for the endocardial cell does not show biphasic behavior in the frequency-dependence of both peak [Ca2+]i transients and peak contraction force, but at least qualitatively, reproduced saturation and even decrease in sarcomere shortening and contraction force amplitude at 4-Hz stimulation the endocardial cells demonstrate significantly larger [Ca2+]i transients, and our modeling predicts larger contraction force and shortening in these ventricular myocytes.

Oscillations occurred in a restricted region of the parametric space defined by the SODs and ROS production in the respiratory chain. the higher the antioxidant capacity of the periplasm-cytoplasm, the larger the parametric space compatible with functional behavior. As a result when Cu, Zn SOD concentration increases, the ability of the two compartments to tolerate higher mitochondrial ROS production is enhanced, even at low concentrations of MnSOD. The inverse amplitude vs. frequency relationship was demonstrated previously (Aon et al., 2006) and is confirmed by the present, more elaborate, ME-R model. Specifically, the 3D phase space projection of the dynamics of H2O2 released as a function of other energetic variables (ŒîŒ®m, succinate) demonstrates the dynamic-functional interrelationships between processes occurring within the same time scale (seconds).

This is consistent with the findings of Kussmaul and Hirst Model simulations of NADH oxidation rates as a function of Q pool redox state at various fixed Œîp‚Äôs\" Model simulations of NADH oxidation rates as a function of Q pool redox state at various fixed Œîp‚Äôs The model is hypersensitive to Œîp, and at Œîp\u003c 100 mV the rate of NADH oxidation is increasingly insensitive to the Q pool redox state and only depends on the NAD(H) pool redox state we do not have sufficient data to conclusively determine how the energetic cost of proton pumping is distributed in the reaction mechanism Model simulation of ROS stoichiometric coefficient, n, NADH oxidation, and ROS production as a function of ŒîŒ®, matrix pH, %NADH, and %Q\" Model simulation of ROS stoichiometric coefficient, n, NADH oxidation, and ROS production as a function of ŒîŒ®, matrix pH, %NADH, and %Q At low ŒîŒ® and pH, n is small and nearly all of the electrons from NADH reach their intended target, Q. As both ŒîŒ® and pH increase, not only does n increase, but also, the amount of RET increases as well the model predicts that ROS are produced in greater excess during RET versus FE the fraction of electrons reducing oxygen becomes quite significant when both the NAD(H) and Q pools are highly reduced pumping mechanism that is directly coupled to the reduction of the SQ in the reaction scheme is thermodynamically and kinetically feasible.
