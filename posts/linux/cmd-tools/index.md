## zsh improved framework (zimfw)

Zsh improved framework, aka [`zimfw`](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw), is a blazing fast zsh plugin framework, about 30x faster loading speed than [oh-my-zsh][].

Install `zsh` first and run the script

```bash
wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

**Powerlevel10k (p10k) prompt**

[Source](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#zim)

1. In `~/.zimrc`, replace `zmodule asciiship` with `zmodule romkatv/powerlevel10k`
2. Run `zimfw install` in zsh.
3. Install [powerline fonts](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#manual) for proper font rendering.
4. Restart zsh and go through p10k's interactive setup.

**Node version manager (nvm)**

Add this line in `~/.zimrc`: `zmodule lukechilds/zsh-nvm`, and then run `zimfw install` in zsh.

To save loading time of zsh (about 70x), you can enable lazy loading by adding the following line to `~/.zshrc`, before loading zmodules:

```bash
export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true
```
